"""SDK results as JSON, in exactly one place.

Almost nothing here is conversion. The SDK's results are pydantic models whose digests already serialize as
``"sha256:..."``, so ``model_dump(mode="json")`` is most of the job. What this module adds is the part
``model_dump`` cannot see: the **computed** properties. ``Snapshot.digest``, ``EvidenceBundle.all_verified``
and ``CascadePlan.size`` are derived rather than stored, and they are the values a caller reads first --
which version is this, did everything verify, how much would this drop take with it.

Two rules, and they are what make this module worth existing rather than being inlined into the CLI:

**Every function is deliberately dumb.** A function that reshapes a result is a function whose output has to
be trusted separately from the SDK's. Keeping the shape flat and adding only derived values means a caller
sees what the protocol produced.

**This is the only place it happens.** The CLI's ``--json``, the MCP server's tool results and the API's
response bodies all serialize the dictionaries built here. Three serializers over the same models would
drift, and the drift would show up as three different answers to the same question.

Modelled on ``sandbox/boltzmann_sandbox/wire.py`` in the SDK repository, including its discipline about which
computed properties to surface.
